# Django Landmarks Blog

This is a Django-based web application for a personal landmark blog. The blog allows an admin to post landmarks, which can be viewed by users. Users can explore the places, add them to a "Read Later" list, delete places from the list, view detailed information about each place, leave comments, and manage their own Read Later list.<br>

## Project Background

This project is based on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's tutorial on Udemy Python Django - The Practical Guide. I have made some modifications to the original project and I built upon that foundation to extend the project's functionality and address specific requirements. However, the course inspired the core concept and initial implementation and the work of the original author.
